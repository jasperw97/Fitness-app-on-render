export const p1 = `In this guide, you will learn about several ways you can incorporate 
                lower body training at home, progressing from the easiest levels.`
export const t2 = "Basics"
export const p2 = `It is important to build a solid base before putting your body to intense training. 
                Isometric training, during which your muscles are neither lengthening nor shortening, 
                is an effective way to recruit muscles at certain positions and teach your body how to 
                use the muscles correctly.`
export const p3 = `Glute Bridge Holds: Lie down on a mat and then perform a glute bridge, but stop at 
                the top and hold for 15 seconds. During this 15 seconds, squeeze your glutes as hard as 
                possible and increase the time as you progress. Do this for every exercise in this section. 
                Another way to progress this exercise is to do it with just one leg.`
export const p4 = `Wall Sits: Position your back against the wall and slowly lower your body until your knees reach 
                90 degrees just like you are sitting on an imaginary chair. During the exercise, focus on pushing your feet into the ground. `
export const p5 = `Lunge Holds: Perform a lunge and hold at the lowest point. Focus on squeezing and trying to bring your front 
                and back feet together, but not actually moving your feet.`
export const t6 = "Intermediate"
export const p6 = `Now we start challenging our lower body muscles and get into the more 
                challenging exercises.`
export const p7 = `Squat: For most beginners, performing a bodyweight squat correctly is an effective 
                way to train your quads and glutes. Check out our Instagram page to learn about the 
                ideal squatting form. To progress this exercise, you can add a jump after each rep.`
export const p8 = `Bulgarian Split Squats: This is performed be putting your rear foot on an elevated surface
                and performing a single legged squat. This exercse is more difficult compare to a normal squat since 
                it only uses one leg and challenges the smaller muscles that are responsible for maintaining balance.
                If you want to make this exercise even harder, you can carry some weights or add a jump to each rep.`
export const t9 = "Advanced"
export const p9 = `Once you get very comfortable performing the exercises above, here is one more 
                exercise to challenge you.`
export const p10 = `Pistol Squats: This is exceptionally harder than a Bulgarian Split Squat because 
                there's no rear foot to support you and it challenges your balance. If you find it 
                difficult in the beginning, try performing it while holding on to something for support like a wall.`
export const p11 = `There are no secrets to building a strong lower body. Just start and stay consistent. Remember, the 
                foundations are very important and you shouldn't skip any step.`

export const title_zh = "下半身訓練"
export const p1z = `在這個健身手冊，你將會學習到如何在家不用到任何器材鍛鍊下半身。包括從最基礎的
                    動作到進階的。`
export const t2z = "基礎"
export const p2z = `在進行高強度訓練之前，建立穩固的基礎是非常重要的。等長訓練是一種在肌肉不延長也不縮短的過程中，
能夠有效徵召特定位置的肌肉，並教導身體如何正確使用這些肌肉的方法。`
export const p3z = `橋式撐：躺在墊子上，進行臀橋運動，但在最高點停下來，並撐15秒。在這15秒內，儘可能地收緊臀部肌肉，並隨著進步逐漸延長時間。本段落中的每個動作都應該這樣進行。另一種進階方式是只用單腿進行此動作。`
export const p4z = `靠牆蹲：將背部靠在牆上，慢慢降低身體，直到膝蓋達到90度撐住，就像坐在一張想像中的椅子上一樣。在進行此動作時，專注於將雙腳用力推向地面。`
export const p5z = `弓箭步撐：進行弓步動作，並在最低點停留。專注於收緊肌肉，並嘗試將前腳和後腳往中間移動，但實際上不要移動雙腳。`
export const t6z = "中階"
export const p6z = `現在我們開始進行更具挑戰性的訓練。`
export const p7z = `深蹲：對於大多數初學者來說，正確地進行無負重深蹲是鍛鍊股四頭肌和臀部的有效方法。請查看我們的Instagram頁面，了解理想的深蹲動作。要提升此訓練難度，你可以在每次深蹲後加入跳躍動作。`
export const p8z = `保加利亞分腿蹲：這個動作是將後腳放在一個抬高的表面上，並進行單腿深蹲。相比於普通深蹲，這個動作更難，因為它只使用一條腿，並挑戰負責維持平衡的小肌肉。如果你想進一步增加難度，可以負重或在每次蹲後加入跳躍動作。`
export const t9z = "進階"
export const p9z = `當你對上述動作非常熟練後，這裡還有一個動作可以挑戰你。`
export const p10z = `單腳深蹲：這比保加利亞分腿蹲難度更高，因為沒有後腳來支撐，並且會挑戰你的平衡。如果一開始覺得很困難，可以試著在做這個動作時扶住一些支撐物，例如牆壁。`
export const p11z = `建立強壯的下半身沒有捷徑，只要踏出第一步並且堅持，就可以看到成果。`
